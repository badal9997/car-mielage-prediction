# Mileage Prediction

This project aims to predict the **miles per gallon (MPG)** of a car based on various features such as engine size, weight, acceleration, etc. The model uses machine learning to find relationships between these features and MPG, providing insights into fuel efficiency.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset (`auto_mpg.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the entire pipeline.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
